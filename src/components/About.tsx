          Hi. I'm Ani Desikan, and I'm a bioinformaticist with a great deal of
          interest in web development and machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a Master's degree in Bioinformatics from Boston University, and
          I'm currently working as a web developer for HoTResDB for the Connor
          Lab in Boston University. I'm also currently working as a backend
          programmer for the Machine Learning Research Group at Boston
          University.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a background in wet lab, mostly in genetic engineering, so
          I understand how daunting and difficult many bioinformatic tools can
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional goal is to develop easy to use tools that can help
          people researching biology, so that results and conclusions can be
          found more quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please let me know if any of my projects interest you, or if you have
          have any questions about my work!
